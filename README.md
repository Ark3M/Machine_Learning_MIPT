# Machine_Learning_MIPT
Seminars from K. Vorontsov's Math ML course at MIPT

You can find lectures (in Russian) [here](https://bit.ly/ML-Vorontsov).
All the seminars are adapted from A. Hraboviy's [materials](https://github.com/andriygav/MachineLearningSeminars) and traslated from Russian into English by me.
